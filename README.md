# Just some experiment using Grunt

The code is based on the famous [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/)

The first thing, I started reading the book "Developing Backbone.js Applications" by Addy Osmani.  
The second thing, I heard that Grunt is a very nice tool.  
So, as I was reading the book, I started play with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

This contains a very basic config that does only one thing:
- generate a build directory containing an optimized js source.

    $ npm install
    $ node_modules/grunt/bin/grunt
